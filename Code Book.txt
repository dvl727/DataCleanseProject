## Project Description
This dataset is from an experiment carried out on a group of 30 volunteers at the SmartLab Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory.  The volunteers were between the ages of 18-48 years old.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.  


##Study design and data processing
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
###Collection of the raw data
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
 
###Notes on the original (raw) data 
 The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
 
 For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
 
 
 The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt':  This includes an explanation of the overall experiment and details on how the data was collected.

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name (i.e walking, sitting,standing, etc).

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training user set.  Contains all features for the 'train' volunteers collected data

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.  Contains corresponding activities for each record in the X_train.txt file

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.  Contains all features for the 'test' volunteers collected data.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. Contains corresponding activities for each record in the X_test.txt file

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

##Creating the tidy datafile
 
###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/
 1. Download the raw data to your working directory from the site: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
 2. Unzip the file into your working directory.
 3. Download the run_analysis.R script into your working directory.  Execute the run_analysis.R in R console or R Studio.
 4. The tidy dataset is located in the dataframe named 'avg_act'.

 ###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()
 The run_anaysis.R script reads the data files you have unzipped into your working directory and combines the needed data files into a tidy dataset.
 It performed the following activities:
 1.  Loads the needed R Packages
 2.  Reads and sets the current working directory
 3.  From the working directory, it determines the location of the data files using relative file paths from the working directory
 4.  It reads the 'features.txt', 'activity_labels.txt', 'X_test.txt', 'Y_test.txt', 'X_train', 'Y_train', and 'subject_test.txt' data files.
 5.  Renames the subject_id and activity_id columns in the subject_test.txt and activity_label files.
 6.  Adds the subject_id and activity_id records to the test and train data files.
 7.  Adds the feature names as columns to the dataset
 8.  Merges the test and train datasets into a combined dataset with the same columns (features).
 9.  Limits data to only features related to the mean and standard devation features.
 10.  Relabels the merged dataset columns per standards (CamelCase, consistency, remove errors in name i.e. BodyBody)
 11.  Summarizes the dataset by Subject_Id and Activity_ID and calculates the average value for each feature.
